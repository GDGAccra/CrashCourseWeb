This will be a guide to understanding HTML.
Remember, you are responsible for majority of the work. Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/GDGAccra/CrashCourseWeb/wiki) for more resources to aid you on this quest.

:question: You could use [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) to test or render html/css/js pages.


## Exercise one

  **HTML Elements <Tags>** : Defined  by a starting **tag** ``<tag>`` and *usually* a closing **tag** `<\tag>`. If this element has content, it will be placed between the start tag and closing tag.
  - Find out what the tags listed in **exercise_one_html** do.
  - Follow the example in the exercise file and do same for all the tags. :memo: hint. use the backtick delimiters

## Exercise two

 Perform the task set out in exercise two. With a little extra knowledge and cunning, you should be able to do this.
 - Put solution to test within the "````" backtick delimiters"
 - Same as before, push completed work to your github repo.


## Exercise three

Add comments in  **exercise_three_html.md**.
Explain in the comment each new tag you come across.
Place emphasis  on the meta tags. What do those two stand for? Why are they important?
Push completed work and send in a PR


## Exercise four

Correct the problems on this page **exercise_four_html.md** and

- make background blue
- change title to exercise 4
- move 'h1' content to the center
- explain 'async' used in the script tags. Do this in a comment.
- *hint* There are images on this page
- what is the purpose of the ``alt`` attribute in ``img`` tag.
